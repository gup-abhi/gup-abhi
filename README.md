  ## 🎯 What I'm all about
  
    Just a developer who loves turning caffeine into code! Currently diving deep into AI integrations while looking 
    for next opportunity to create an impact. I get excited about building things that actually solve problems and 
    make people's lives easier.
  
    When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me:
    - 🤖 Experimenting with AI-powered features
    - 🚀 Building full-stack apps that don't crash (learned that the hard way!)
    - 📚 Learning something new every day
    - 🌟 Contributing to open source when I can
  
  ## 🔮 Currently vibing with
  
  ```typescript
  const currentlyBuilding = {
    projects: ["AI Journal App"],
    learning: ["AI Usecases", "AI Agents", "System Design"],
    exploring: ["AI automation workflows", "React Native", "n8n"],
    nextGoal: "Create a product that becomes as natural as brushing your teeth—something people can’t imagine
      their day without."
  };
  ```
  
  ## 🛠️ My toolbox
  
    The tech I love working with (and the ones that love me back):
  
  **Frontend Magic** ✨

  ## 🚀 Some stuff I've built
  
  ### 🧠 [AI Journal App (Currently Working On)](https://ai-journaling.onrender.com/)
    Ever wanted to know what your journal entries really mean? This app uses AI to analyze your thoughts and 
    give you insights about your mood and themes. It's like having a therapist, but cheaper!
  
  *Built with: React Native, Node.js, MongoDB, AI APIs, Supabase*
  
  ### 💸 [Expense Wallet](https://github.com/gup-abhi/expense-wallet-frontend)
    Because tracking expenses shouldn't be as painful as spending money. Clean, simple, and works on your phone too.
  
  *Built with: React Native, Express.js, Clerk Auth*
  
  ### 💬 [Real-time Chat App](https://chat-app-7ruk.onrender.com/)
    Real-time messaging with all the bells and whistles. Online status, media sharing, and a dark mode that won't 
    hurt your eyes during those late-night coding sessions.
  
  *Built with: React, Socket.IO, MongoDB*
  
  ## 🎨 Fun Facts & AI Adventures
  
    - 🤖 I've probably tested every major AI model released in 2024 (and have strong opinions about each!)
    - 🧠 Built my first **n8n automation** that saves me 2 hours daily (best investment ever)
    - ⚡ **Cursor AI** has become my pair programming buddy—it's better than most humans at code reviews
    - 🔮 Currently experimenting with **multi-agent systems** where AIs talk to each other (it's wild!)
    - 🎯 My AI agents have probably written 30% of my recent code (and it's good code!)
    - 📊 I benchmark different AI models weekly to find the perfect fit for each use case
    - 🕵️ **TryHackMe addict** - solving rooms is my version of sudoku (currently ranked in top 5% globally!)
    - 🔧 **Tool enthusiast** - I've tried every productivity app, dev tool, and gadget that promises to make me 2% more efficient
    - 🚀 Once built an AI workflow that automatically applied to jobs while I slept (ethical? debatable. effective? absolutely!)
    - 💡 My dream: Building an AI that can build other AIs (we're getting close!)
    - 🎮 I gamify everything - from learning new tech to solving security challenges
    - 🛡️ Web exploitation on TryHackMe taught me to build more secure applications (and break insecure ones!)
