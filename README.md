## 🎯 What I'm all about

Just a developer who loves turning caffeine into code! Currently diving deep into AI integrations while pursuing my Master's at Concordia University in Montreal. I get excited about building things that actually solve problems and make people's lives easier.

When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me:
- 🤖 Experimenting with AI-powered features
- 🚀 Building full-stack apps that don't crash (learned that the hard way!)
- 📚 Learning something new every day
- 🌟 Contributing to open source when I can

## 🔮 Currently vibing with

```typescript
const currentlyBuilding = {
  projects: ["AI Journal App", "Expense tracking tools"],
  learning: ["AI Usecases", "AI Agents", "System Design"],
  exploring: ["AI automation workflows", "React Native", "n8n"],
  nextGoal: "Create a product that becomes as natural as brushing your teeth—something people can’t imagine their day without.'"
};
```

## 🚀 Some stuff I've built

### 🧠 [AI Journal App](https://ai-journaling.onrender.com/)
Ever wanted to know what your journal entries really mean? This app uses AI to analyze your thoughts and give you insights about your mood and themes. It's like having a therapist, but cheaper! 

*Built with: React, Node.js, MongoDB, AI APIs*

### 💸 [Expense Wallet](https://github.com/gup-abhi/expense-wallet-frontend)
Because tracking expenses shouldn't be as painful as spending money. Clean, simple, and works on your phone too.

*Built with: React Native, Express.js, Clerk Auth*

### 💬 [Real-time Chat App](https://chat-app-7ruk.onrender.com/)
Real-time messaging with all the bells and whistles. Online status, media sharing, and a dark mode that won't hurt your eyes during those late-night coding sessions.

*Built with: React, Socket.IO, MongoDB*

## 🎨 Fun Facts & AI Adventures

- 🤖 I've probably tested every major AI model released in 2024 (and have strong opinions about each!)
- 🧠 Built my first **n8n automation** that saves me 2 hours daily (best investment ever)
- ⚡ **Cursor AI** has become my pair programming buddy—it's better than most humans at code reviews
- 🔮 Currently experimenting with **multi-agent systems** where AIs talk to each other (it's wild!)
- 🎯 My AI agents have probably written 30% of my recent code (and it's good code!)
- 📊 I benchmark different AI models weekly to find the perfect fit for each use case
- 🕵️ **TryHackMe addict** - solving rooms is my version of sudoku (currently ranked in top 5% globally!)
- 🔧 **Tool enthusiast** - I've tried every productivity app, dev tool, and gadget that promises to make me 2% more efficient
- 🚀 Once built an AI workflow that automatically applied to jobs while I slept (ethical? debatable. effective? absolutely!)
- 💡 My dream: Building an AI that can build other AIs (we're getting close!)
- 🎮 I gamify everything - from learning new tech to solving security challenges
- 🛡️ Web exploitation on TryHackMe taught me to build more secure applications (and break insecure ones!)
